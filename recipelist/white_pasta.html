    <img src="../images/white-sauce-pasta.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Step 1 Cook the pasta in sufficient water
        For preparing this pasta recipe, add water, oil and 1 tsp salt in a container. Heat it for a minute on a high flame. Keep stirring from time to time. Add pasta to it and heat it for additional 10 minutes on medium flame. Make sure that the pasta is boiled properly as sometimes it may take some extra time. Keep stirring in between so that the pasta doesn't stick to the bottom of the container. After boiling, drain out the water from pasta.
    <br>
    Step 2 Chop all the veggies and saute them for 2 minutes
    Chop all the vegetables into small pieces and keep them aside. Add butter to a pan and heat it for 30 seconds over moderate flame. Now add onions to the pan and saute it for 2 minutes or till they turn slightly pinkish in colour. Add mushroom, baby corn, capsicum, oregano and saute them for 5 minutes.
<br>
Step 3 Add cream and cornflour to the veggies along with spices
Add cornflour to the cooked vegetables in the pan and keep stirring. Add salt, pepper, red chilli flakes, milk and simmer it for another 5-6 minutes. Now add cream and boiled pasta to the mixture and heat it for 2 minutes.
<br>
Step 4 Garnish with cheese and serve with seasonings
Garnish with cheese and grill it for 5 minutes. Hot white sauce pasta is ready to be served. Garnish with oregano seasoning and chilli flakes. Enjoy!
